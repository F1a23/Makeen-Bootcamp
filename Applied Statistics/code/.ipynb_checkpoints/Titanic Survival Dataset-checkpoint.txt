Titanic Survival Dataset

Dataset: titanic.csv (available on Kaggle or seaborn’s built-in dataset)
Link for the dataset: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/yasserh/titanic-dataset

Problem Statement:

You are analyzing survival data from the Titanic disaster.
Using the dataset, calculate the following probabilities:

P(Survived) – the probability that a passenger survived.
P(Survived | Sex = 'female') – the probability of survival given that the passenger is female.
P(Survived | Pclass = 1) – the probability that a first-class passenger survived.
P(Sex = 'female' | Survived = 1) – the probability that a passenger was female given that they survived.

IMPORTANT: Compare these probabilities and discuss what they reveal about gender and class bias in survival rates.

Skills Practiced:
pandas filtering and counting
Conditional probability computation using groupby
Data insight interpretation
